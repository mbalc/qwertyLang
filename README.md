--  Still a number of features missing (commented out from syntax) but base skeleton done
--  Main features that work:
--  - printing (polymorphic)
--  - Hiding of labels in store; blocks
--  Main problems to fix:
--  - Code should be better, more modular
--  - More syntax should be in denotational style
--  - Missing major features like loops&control, function results, typechecking
--  - Some smaller features missing - left to do because it'd be better if I do
--    - denotational refactor first, haven't managed to do it all and I wanted to rather
--    - focus on features
--  I see that after writing this code I understand the idea much better already,
--    it's not a leap in the dark to write sth like this anymore and I'm really looking
--    forward to finishing this project
